    <p>characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share fromatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .CSS file,</p>
    <p>wich reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load</p>
    <p>speed between the pages that share the file and its fromatting.</p>
